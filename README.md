# JetBrains Academy Project: Maze Runner
## Learning outcomes
Learn to use Random class with lists and multidimensional arrays and store the results in a file.
## About
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.
